# Text Preprocessing and Analysis Project

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The workflow includes:
- Text tokenization
- Removing punctuation and stopwords
- Analyzing word frequencies
- Part-of-speech tagging
- Generating visualizations such as word clouds, bar charts, and network graphs

---

## Features
1. **Text Analysis**:
   - Tokenization of text into sentences and words.
   - Removing punctuation marks and stopwords.
   - Finding and visualizing word frequencies.
   - Identifying parts of speech (PoS).

2. **Visualization**:
   - Word clouds to highlight frequent words.
   - Bar charts to visualize word frequency distributions.
   - Network graphs to analyze word co-occurrences or sentence relationships.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Modular functions designed to handle varying file inputs and perform custom analyses.
